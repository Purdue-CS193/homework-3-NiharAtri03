Q1: What are the 3 commands to transfer something from your local codebase to GitHub?
The three commands are git add, git commit, and git push.

Q2: What does 'git clone' do? 
Git clone copies the repository in GitHub to my computer.

Q3: What does 'git status' do?
Git status shows what is happening in my local repository.

Q4: What does "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tell you?
This means that the files in my local repository are the same as the files in the GitHub repository.

Q5: You’ve made a change to a file in GitHub, the one on the browser, and now you run 'git status' on the terminal. It still says "Up to Date" despite the change. What command do you need to enter first?
I need to enter git fetch.

Q6: You’ve just ran the 'rm' command and deleted an important file. All your code is deleted, not including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit' before the rogue command. Is your code saved?
Yes, my code is saved since I committed it before I deleted the file.

Q7: Your computer crashes and all your code is deleted, including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit'. Is your code saved?
No, since the local repository was deleted when my computer crashed.
